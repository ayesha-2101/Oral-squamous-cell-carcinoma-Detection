# Oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma-Detection
ML Project - Learning Phase
Welcome to the Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) Machine Learning Project. 
The primary objective of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques to gain insights into OSCC, which is a type of cancer that affects the mouth and throat.
- Objective: Our main goal is to develop predictive models and gain a deeper understanding of OSCC.
- Dataset: We have used a comprehensive dataset containing clinical, genetic, and histopathological information related to OSCC patients. The dataset is available online.
- Methods: In this project, we employ various machine learning algorithms such as [list algorithms] to analyze and predict OSCC-related outcomes.
- Results: We will summarize our findings, including any significant correlations, predictive models, and insights into OSCC.
